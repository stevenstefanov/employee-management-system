# Employee Management System

## What is the project?

This project is an employee management system. It allows a user to be able to easily interact with a employee database to view, add, edit, and delete data from the database such as employees, roles, departments and managers.

## Why did I decide to do this project?

This project helps team managers to be able to manage their teams and see payroll and employee lists.

## What I learned in the process?

I became a lot more comfortable with inquirer, sequelize, and mysql. I learned really how useful sequelize is and all that can be done with it.

## What makes this project stand out?

This project combines the use of multiple npm packages to make a very useful tool.
